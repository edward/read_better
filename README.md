# ReadBetter

This tool helps you read better content by doing two things:

* It makes you more aware of how many times you visit the online news sites and social networks that pervade our lives with interesting but relatively shallow content
* It shows you the books and papers you’ve been trying read but perhaps don’t seem to be able to as much as you’d like

## Installation

It’s pretty straightforward:

    $ gem install read_better

## Configuration

Edit your /etc/hosts file to have entries for your news sites and social networks and point them to read.better, the local application.

Here’s an example:

    reddit.com    read.better

## Usage

Visit your favourite news sites. Add books you’re reading.
Become aware of where your time is going and what you’re not doing.
